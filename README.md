## About
I always loved to acquire new skills and knowledge, that is why after finishing my Bachelor's in "Multimedia and Internet Technologies" at Vytautas Magnus University I decided to go study Master's and currently I am studying in the program "Digital Culture" at Kaunas University of Technology. My main area of research during studies: how digital algorithms impact society and culture of algorithms. Beside formal studies, I am currently also studying Data Analytics at Turing College where I combine knowledge about algorithms and society with new skills in data analysis. Here I got the knowledge of using SQL, spreadsheets, Data Studio, all the main things for data gathering, analysis and visualization.

All the main skill that I aquired can be seen in my resume generated by Turing college: [Turing College resume](https://intra.turingcollege.com/s/mlekec-c35a7)

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics field.

### The Look customer analysis
**Description:** The report is concentrating around customer analysis. Customer analytics refers to a collection of data points that indicate what customers are interacting with, how, and for how long. Interpreting those data can help understand whatâ€™s resonating among different customer segments. The report analyses the data from [TheLook](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data&d=thelook_ecommerce&page=dataset) - eCommerce clothing site developed by the Looker team. This public dataset is hosted in Google BigQuery.
